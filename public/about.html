                <p style="text-align: center; width: 75rem; font-size: medium;">
                    For this project, we created a single page application about
                    crimes in St. Paul Minnesota. The project consisted of the Vue
                    framework and 3 APIs (Leaflet, Nominatim, and our own API). This 
                    single page application will allow users to traverse the map and 
                    see the different crimes update in the table.

                I am a senior studying Computer Science at the University of St. Thomas. I enjoy being outside, 
                sports, being active, music, reading, and being with friends and family. I have a dog named Leo and my roommate
                has two cats, Pickle and Poppy. I love to travel and hope that I have the opportunity to do so after graduation.
